I'm Anna Lee, a new interactive designer.
Hi, Anna.
Mr. Quarry is at his office.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Good morning. I'm Anali, a new interactive designer.
Hi, Anna. Mr. Query is at his office.
Thanks.
Come in.
Hi, Anna. Please have a seat.
Hi. How are you?
Welcome aboard. I'll show you around the office.
Thanks.
This is your seat. I tried to get what you had requested.
21-inch monitor, wireless, mouse, and so on.
Good morning, Mark. Oh, good morning.
This is Anna, our new interactive designer.
This is Bob, our front-end developer.
Hi. Welcome aboard. Hi.
This is Emily, our senior planner.
She's an integral part of our company.
Nice to meet you. And you too.
This is the sales department. They're in a meeting now.
I'll introduce them later. Okay.
Good morning, Carmen. Good morning. Is she new?
Yeah. Anna is the new designer.
Hi, Anna. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Carmen is our administrator.
Please come and see me after the tour.
I will.
It's the cafeteria.
Those soft drinks and snacks are free.
But you have to pay to use the vending machine.
Hi, C. Do any of the colleagues bring their lunches?
Yes.
Carmen will let you know some more information including paperwork.
Her seat is over there.
Oh, okay. I'll talk to her. Thanks.
Excuse me, Carmen. Do you have a minute?
Yes. What's up?
I have some papers to fix, but have no idea how to use the machine.
Oh, okay.
How many pages do you have?
Five.
Place them face up.
Then dial the number starting with one.
Uh-huh.
What's the fax number?
It's five, six, four, three, one, two, zero, nine, eight, seven.
When you hear a sound like a computer modem, press send.
All done.
Great. Thanks so much.
No problem.
Hey, lunch, buddy.
Hey.
Are we on for lunch today?
Yeah.
What time?
One.
Okay. Is Mike joining us?
I'm not sure.
Let me ask him.
Hey.
Hey.
Anna and I are going to lunch. Are you in?
I can't take a lunch break since the deadline for this catalog is today.
I see.
Can we have lunch together tomorrow?
Sure. Sure.
Okay.
Hey.
What do you want to have?
Maybe a burrito.
Okay. Let's go. It's one ten already.
My stomach is growling.
Two chicken burritos, please.
Hi, Mark.
Hi.
Hi, ladies. Back from lunch.
Yeah. Have you had lunch?
Uh-huh.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Okay.
Talk to you later.
Emily, can I bump a sig?
Here you are.
We should be considerate of her.
Anna, do you smoke too?
Nah. I don't. I have bronchitis.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You'd better go inside.
Okay. Talk to you later, guys.
Anna.
Hey, Anna. There you are.
What's up?
Mark was just looking for you.
Where is he?
In his office.
Okay. Thanks.
Oh, come in.
Huh?
Bless you.
Thanks.
You were looking for me?
Yes, I was.
I was going to ask you something, but I just figured it out.
What was that?
I wanted to check if our flash banner was up.
You can check it on the admin page.
I just remembered that. Thanks.
Sure.
Well, let's call it a day.
Did you finish the image map?
Yes, I just did.
It's been a long day.
What about having a quick drink?
Sounds good.
What about you, Mike?
Can I take a rain check?
I've got to wrap some things up.
Okay. Let's go.
I've got to stop by Mr. Chuck's office to give him this.
You want me to wait outside?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
All right. See you at the lobby.
Hey.
Are you leaving already?
Come on. It's a quarter to seven already.
Yeah. I'm about to leave as well.
You take care.
You too. Drive safe.
Hi, Anna. How are you doing?
I'm doing great. How about yourself?
I'm doing good. Thanks for asking.
By the way, can I ask you a favor?
Sure. What's that?
I need some copies of the contract proposals from Enron.
Not just email estimates.
When do you need them by?
Can I get them now?
Sorry, but I'm up to my ears and work at the moment.
I can take care of it late this afternoon.
Okay. But I hope to get them by five at the latest.
All right.
Thank you in advance.
Hi, Matthew. Here are the copies you asked for.
Please make sure they aren't any pages missing.
I appreciate it.
No problem.
I need to write an email.
Dear Keith, I apologize for the delay in my reply.
As I have been having trouble with my office email account,
please send all future correspondence to my personal email address.
I will be happy to assist your organization in creating a new email.
I will be happy to assist you with your new email address.
I will be happy to assist you with your new email address.
I will be happy to assist your organization in creating a local design.
Mark has mentioned designing your local, brochures, and newsletters.
First, I need to confirm what kind of graphic materials you need.
After you provide me with the rough guidelines in PDF format,
I will email the address for you to review.
The best way to contact me during the day will be through AOL Messenger.
My cell phone number is 213-456-7890.
But it's not easy for me to receive calls while at work.
I'm looking forward to working with you, respectfully and allee.
Hello.
Hello. May I speak to Keith Mitchell, please?
May I ask who is calling?
This is Anna Lee from Media ABC.
Just a moment, please.
Okay.
Hello, Anna. How are you?
Fine. Thanks for asking. How about you?
Same here.
I'm calling you to let you know that I just sent you an email regarding the local design.
Great. I will check it immediately.
As mentioned in the mail, my company email account isn't working properly.
Okay, then how can I reach you?
Please email me at Anna Lee at cmail.com and send a text message if possible.
No problem. I will do that.
Good. Have a nice day.
Thanks, Anna. I'll get back to you soon.
We will be having a meeting today.
Hi, everyone. We will be having a meeting today from 3pm to 5pm in the conference room.
All members in the marketing department are expected to attend.
The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the web marketing service that we need.
Okay. Thanks. Mark.
Hi, Emily. Did you get the email about the meeting this afternoon?
Yes, I did.
Can you make it?
Yes, I will be there.
Great. I'd like to put you in charge of reviewing last year's SEO.
Sure, I can do that.
I think there is a related file in my folder.
Good.
You'll have 5 to 10 minutes to remind us of how we proceeded with the project last year.
5 minutes would be enough.
Probably. That will help members to understand our working process for online marketing.
Okay, sir.
Thanks. I'll see you then.
See you then.
You need a hand?
Thanks. You're a life saver.
Thank you all for attending.
As you can see, there are four items to cover on the agenda.
1. Search Engine Ranking.
2. Improving Web Performance.
3. Paper Click Marketing.
4. Social Networking and Social Media Marketing.
First, let me start off by saying thank you for your outstanding contribution to the success of the project.
All right.
The first agenda item is about improving our search engine ranking.
Emily, could you briefly remind us about the successful SEO strategy?
Sure. There are 9 essential rules for a successful SEO strategy.
1. Content is Key.
2. Google's Keyword to Alize.
3. Social Networks are important and highly integrated.
4. Google Plus is vital.
5. Link Building Drives Credibility.
6. Black Ops will get you banned.
7. Google Authorship is mandatory.
8. The Rules Change. Literally Daily.
9. It Takes Constant Feeding to Stay On Top.
Thanks, Emily. Let's get back to the main issue.
We've been spending so much money on aggressive search engine optimization.
I strongly believe that we should cut the budget and use social networking websites instead.
I would like to hear your thoughts and ideas.
Yes, Mike?
I think we have to try to think outside the box.
Hi, Mark. I was wondering if it would be possible to have a few days off.
Is there any problem?
My grandmother is in critical condition in ICU.
And I'd like to see her in case something happens.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How much time off do you need?
She is on the east coast. I guess probably 3-4 days.
OK. You will need to submit a request for a leave of absence.
Oh, OK.
If you need a hand, let me know.
Thanks, Mark.
Dear Frank, I would like to request a leave of absence due to a family matter.
My grandmother is in ICU and I would like to personally tend to her needs at this time.
I would like to request 4 days of leave.
I will report for work again on the 26th.
I would like to thank the management with all my heart for the continuous support it has given me.
Sincerely, Analy.
Hello. This is Anna from MediaABC.
May I speak to Stacy Crary?
I'm sorry, but there's no one here by that name.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm looking for Mark Crary.
Oh, OK. I'll transfer your call.
Thanks.
Hello. I'm sorry, but he is not at his desk at this moment.
Would you like to leave a message for him?
Yes, please. This is Mary Kramer from Atman.
I'd like to receive a confirmation letter in regards to the media expo.
Oh, OK.
Could you please ask him to call me back?
I will. He'll be back soon.
Thanks.
Would you like me to give you his direct extension number?
That would be great.
It's 765-432-1098.
I appreciate it.
Hi, Anna. Do you have a minute?
Can I see you in my office?
Sure.
What's up?
Take a seat.
As you know, there's an upcoming conference being held by MG next month.
The one we are going to participate in?
Right. I'd like to hear about the progress of your project before the meeting.
I began implementing the program with Emily.
How is it going?
Smoothly. However, we discovered some mistakes.
How long will it take to fix them?
They will be taken care of immediately after the meeting.
Good. I know we have plenty to do, but let's hang in there.
Yes, we are.
Okay. Please keep me informed of your progress.
I will.
Hello, SVision Network.
Hello, this is Anna Lee from MediaABC.
May I speak with Ms. Wansky? I'm returning her call.
Please hold while I transfer your call.
Thanks.
Hello, this is Tilla speaking.
Hello, Tilla. This is Anna from MediaABC.
I got your message regarding the estimate you drew up.
Yes, according to our marketing department, the estimate I've already sent you is for a week-long ad.
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, but could you discard the one you currently have? I'll recent you the revised one immediately.
Could you fax it to me?
I will. Sorry for the inconvenience.
No worries. I will get in touch with you after reviewing it.
Great. Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.
Thanks. I'll talk to you soon.
Anna, here's your fax.
Thanks a lot.
Dear everyone, employees are prohibited from using cell phones for personal use,
except during scheduled breaks and lunch.
Using a cell phone at your desk is a distraction for the user and to co-workers.
It is important to realize that others can get impatient or irritated when a co-worker stops a conversation
because of an incoming call.
Other employees are also able to hear our conversations.
Your cooperation is expected.
Using a cell phone during work hours could be grounds for a written notice being placed in your personnel file.
Carmen A. Abate
Hey, did you read the email?
The one about the cell phone usage?
Uh-huh.
The policies seem to get stricter every year.
There are surveillance cameras in the office, aren't there?
Yeah, we are being watched. It's suffocating.
Ah.
Congrats, Gina. Thanks.
Congrats.
What's going on here?
Hey, Anna, there's something I want to give you.
A wedding invitation?
Wow, congratulations. You're getting married.
Yes, I am. Finally, huh?
I'm really happy for you.
Thanks. You'll come, won't you?
When is the big day?
It's November 11th. Please RSVP by October 20th.
I definitely will. I can't wait to see you in your wedding gown.
I'm so excited.
Are you planning on having a bridal shower?
I'm not sure yet.
Okay.
I'll let you know later.
Hey, Anna, we're going to the lazy dog for happy hour. Can you make it at 620?
I'm sorry, but can I take a rain check? I have something to do this evening.
That's too bad. We'll probably be there until 8.
I'll just swing by before then.
I don't think I can make it today. Sorry.
Loser.
What did you just say?
I said loser. You're such a party pooper.
Calm down, Anna. You know he's a jerk.
Don't say anything now. You'd better talk to Mark about this.
Okay.
Dear Mark, I would like to speak with you candidly regarding an incident that happened yesterday, 1013.
I trust you to keep this matter confidential. My coworker Dean referred to me as a loser.
So may view this as a bad joke, but this is not the first time.
This same employee has treated me in a hurtful way and made me feel uncomfortable while at work.
This has also been a distraction for me while working.
I have never done anything to have him act like this towards me.
Knowing in my life has ever called me a loser.
I would like to listen to any advice you may have for resolving this issue.
Thank you. Best regards, Anna.
Morning, Anna. Do you have a minute? Sure.
Can I see you in my office? Okay.
I just got your email and wanted to hear exactly what happened yesterday.
Blah blah blah. Loser. Blah blah blah.
I see. If you want, I can report it and HR will handle it.
That would be great.
Okay. That seems the best thing to do based on his usual behavior.
Thanks for understanding.
I have a horrible migraine. I better call in sick today.
Hello, this is Mark. I'm not available at this moment. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Hi, Mark. This is Anna.
I'm not feeling well today and I'd like to talk to you about this.
I'm not feeling well today and I'd like to ask for a day off.
If there is any problem, please give me a call. I'll talk to you later.
Hello, Mark.
Hi, Anna. I just checked your voice message. How are you feeling?
I've had a horrible migraine since I woke up and it's not letting up.
You should take some over the counter medicine, like Tylenol.
Thanks. See you tomorrow.
Hope you feel better soon and I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi, Anna. Are you close to completion with the flash-add?
It was sent to you and C.C. to Frank this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't had a chance to check my email.
Okay. Speaking of the ads, can we bring the meeting forward?
Sure. It can be brought forward from the 15th to the 18th.
Sounds great. We seem to be a week ahead of schedule.
Really? I will probably arrange the call for Monday.
Oh, one more. We have a board meeting early next month.
I'd like to present our new look there. Can you finish it before then?
It's almost done. Great. When can I expect to get the final design?
Just give me a couple more days.
I'll have it to you by the 22nd.
Perfect. Thanks for your hard work.
Flower delivery for Ms. Annoley.
She's in the marketing department. Go straight down the hall.
Thanks.
Is that for Anna? Wow. She's at the corner.
Okay. Ms. Annoley.
Yes. Flower delivery for you.
Me? From who?
There's a note in the basket. You have a wonderful day.
Wow. Anna.
Hey, lady. Who sent the flowers?
No idea. I'm about to check the card.
Who sent it?
D? Who's D?
Isn't it Dean?
No way. What makes you think they're from Dean?
Hmm. Who is it?
Hey. Is that?
I forgot the name of it.
What you might call it, it's on the tip of my tongue.
Ah. I've had mini retina.
That's right.
Do you mind me asking where you bought it?
I got it online.
Hmm. I'm not sure which store it was though.
How much did it cost?
It was basically $699.
But I had a promotion code from the manufacturer
and was luckily able to save about $100.
Amazing. I'm actually looking for a touchpad tablet
and wondering if it performs well.
In terms of portability, it is perfect.
However, the screen seems a little dull to me.
I see. I may go out shopping to compare some first-hand.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Hey.
Hi, Anna. How have you been?
I've been good. How about you?
I've been very busy lately.
It's been a while since we've seen each other.
You're right.
So, how do you like your work?
It's very challenging from time to time,
but I do enjoy working with my colleagues.
I was told that you are a good team player.
I'm glad to hear that.
By the way, have you noticed any recent changes in your office?
What do you mean?
As this business market is getting smaller and worse,
many companies have begun reorganising their departments.
You know that.
Uh-huh.
The economy is in bad shape.
A few employees in my company were laid off in the last three months.
Oh, no. That's too bad.
Has anyone been let go in your office?
Um, not that I know of.
Uh-huh.
Dear Mike,
as you know, recent economic conditions in the industry
have forced us to make some difficult decisions here at media ABC.
It is with regret that I inform you that we have decided
to eliminate the quality department and all positions,
including terminating your employment.
In order for us to succeed in the future,
we must streamline our organisation today.
Please stop by the Human Resources Department
at your earliest convenience to discuss out placement services.
Human resources will also explain your severance package, benefits,
and they can answer any other questions you may have.
We thank you for your service to media ABC.
We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.
Centurally, Frank Kamen, Chief Executive Officer.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Mike.
I just heard the news.
I don't know what to say.
I'm okay, guys.
Her Jake is leaving, too.
He already left an hour ago.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
Let's keep in touch, okay?
Definitely. Call me this weekend. We'll have a drink.
Man, I'll give you a call after work.
Your paycheck, Anna.
Thanks.
Hmm. Hey, did you get paid for working overtime?
Huh?
The overtime hours we worked last month.
Wasn't it about four hours?
Yeah, it was.
But we won't be able to get paid for that.
Why not?
If we work on salary, usually we don't get paid working for overtime.
Oh.
I was just curious because I heard Gina receives overtime pay.
It's because she works hourly.
I see.
Good afternoon.
Thank you for taking time out of your day to be with us.
I'm pleased to introduce Mr. Steve Morrison.
Mr. Morrison is the senior project manager for accessibility at Adobe.
And he is in charge of accessibility across the product line.
Everything from dream weaver to flash to freehand.
Everyone, please give a warm welcome to Mr. Steve Morrison with a big applause.
Hello everyone.
Thank you for your warm welcome.
I am glad to be here with you today.
Before I begin, I would like to learn a little bit about how experienced you are.
Are there any flash developers in the group?
Thank you.
Mr. Stagg.
Mark.
Mr. Stagg.
I'd like you to meet Ms. Annelie.
She's one of my favorite designers in my department.
Anna, this is Mr. Liam Stagg.
Oh.
He is my former supervisor and is currently in WJ Company as a VP.
Hi Anna.
It's great to finally meet you.
I've heard a lot about your outstanding work from your manager.
I'm so flattered to hear that Mr. Stagg.
I read your book about social media marketing.
It was really inspiring.
I'm glad you like it.
We refer to your book at a team meeting.
By the way, congratulations on the successful launch of the new website.
You did a good job.
Thank you sir.
But it wasn't just me.
It was my team, including Anna.
Mr. Mark, to you all.
